        "question": "What is Newton's first law of motion?",
        "answer": "Objects at rest stay at rest and objects in motion continue in the same motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is Newton's second law of motion?",
        "answer": "The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is Newton's thirds law of motion?",
        "answer": "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is velocity?",
        "answer": "Velocity is a vector quantity that describes the motion of objects by specifying both magnitude and direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is acceleration?",
        "answer": "The quantity that describes the rate of change of velocity or the derivative of velocity with respects to time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is time?",
        "answer": "Good question."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is kinetic energy?",
        "answer": "The energy of an object that is due to its motion and particle vibration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is potential energy?",
        "answer": "The energy stored in an object due to its relative position or arrangement of parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the first law of thermodynamics?",
        "answer": "The principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy in a closed system is constant; energy can be transformed but cannot be created or destroyed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the second law of thermodyanmics?",
        "answer": "In any closed system, the total entropy increases with time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the third law of thermodyanimcs?",
        "answer": "As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, the entropy of the system approaches its minimum value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two types of charges and whare is their relationship?",
        "answer": "There is a positive and a negative charge. Like charges repel and opposite charges attract."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a magnetic field?",
        "answer": "A field, generated by moving charges or currents, that exerts forces on other moving charges or magnetic materials "
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the basic composition of an atom?",
        "answer": "An atom is composed of a nucleus, itself made of protons and neutrons, orbited by electrons travelling in distinct probability clouds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an atomic number?",
        "answer": "The atomic number defines the type of element and is determined by the number of protons in the nucleus."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an atomic isotope?",
        "answer": "An element with the same atomic number and similar chemical behaviour but different number of neutrons in the nucleus."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a covalent bond?",
        "answer": "A bond where two or more atoms share electrons between themselves."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an ionic bond?",
        "answer": "A bond formed between charged atoms because of a transfer of electrons."
